I have created a registration and login system using material UI as per provided exercises. I have used Fake AWT auth server in order to get the JWT token and authorize users on login. The authorization is based on the token provided by the server. In order to run the project, please run both fake api server and the react project. I have uploaded server and project to different repositories because of error occurred when adding them on same repo.

For Server, type "npm run start-auth" and for the project "yarn start".

Thank You
